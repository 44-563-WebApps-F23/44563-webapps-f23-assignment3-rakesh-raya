<p>
    I enjoy reading and learning about human psychology. I dislike it when people become overly 
    passionate about trivial issues. I admire people that are emotionally strong. To excel at anything, 
    I purely depend on my capacity to work hard. If I'm in good enough form I like to help strangers 
    with their concerns. When talking with others, I am generally good with my word choice. People are 
    inclined to trust me. It's difficult for me to know when to give up on something.

<h3>My favourite food is Pulihora</h3>
<p>I love Pulihora a lot because of its taste, texture and bright yellow color. It's made of Rice, Lemon, 
    and groundnuts, all together brings a mouthful of water. It tastes sour and soft which feels awesome while
    eating. It can be prepared with Lemon or Tamarind but I prefer the prior one.
