    <h3>My favourite vacation spot is Munnar located in Kerala</h3>
    <p>
        Munnar is a hill station which is called as <b>best destination in God's own country Kerala</b> that
        is situated at an altitude of 6000 feet. It is breathtakingly beautiful <b>- a haven of peace and
            tranquility</b>. It has vast tea plantations on the slopes of the hills making it eye feast. The aroma
        around the town is so pleasant which ties us more and more to that location. Munnar can not be described
        in words which can only be experienced. The hills, the mist, the valleys, the streams, the waterfalls,
        tea plantations are unforgettable scenaries forever in my mind.
