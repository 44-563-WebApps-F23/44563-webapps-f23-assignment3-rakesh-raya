<h2>My favourite vacation spot is Munnar located in Kerala</h2>
<p>
    Munnar is a hill station which is called as <b>God's own country</b> that is situated at an altitude 
    of 6000 feet. It is breathtakingly beautiful <b>- a haven of peace and tranquility</b>. It has vast
    tea plantations on the slopes of the hills making it eye feast. The aroma around the station is so 
    pleasant which ties us more and more to that location. Munnar can not be described in words which
    can only be experienced. The hills, the mist, the valleys, the streams, the waterfalls, tea 
    plantations are unforgettable scenaries forever in my mind.
